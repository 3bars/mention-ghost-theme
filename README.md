##Introduction

Mention is clean and minimalistic theme with few nice features, like scroll indicator 
and reading time. Team Vanila got inspired with https://mention.com/blog/ and the guys from Mention give as green light, to go and craft Ghost theme.

If you can leave that comment in footer that says it's crafted by Vanila (http://vanila.io), it 
would mean a lot, cause it represents our work.

Peace. :)
